            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>
                    I am a passionate and dedicated Civil Engineering graduate with a strong background in Java Full
                    Stack development.
                    Throughout my academic journey, I developed a keen interest in software development and honed my

                    principles and Java full
                    stack development, I am equipped to tackle complex challenges and contribute to the development of
                    robust and user-friendly
                    applications.
                </p>
                <br>

                    CSS, and JavaScript to build scalable
                    and responsive web applications. With a strong focus on clean code and attention to detail, I strive
                    to deliver high-quality solutions
                    that meet both user requirements and industry standards. I am a fast learner, eager to stay updated
                    with the latest industry trends,
                    and I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute my skills and learn from
                    experienced professionals.</p>

            <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Reading Books :</h4>
                    <p>Reading books on self-improvement and mind development is a passion of mine. I find immense value
                        and inspiration in works like "Attitude is Everything" by Jeff Keller, which I have recently
                        completed. This book has had a profound impact on my mindset and has provided me with practical
                        techniques to cultivate a positive attitude and achieve personal growth. Exploring books in this
                        genre allows me to continually learn and expand my knowledge, empowering me to strive for
                        self-improvement in all aspects of my life.</p>

                    <h4>Listening to Music :</h4>
                    <p> Listening to music is another hobby that brings me immense joy and relaxation. I have a
                        particular affinity for Divine Kannada songs, as they captivate me with their melodious tunes
                        and
                        soul-stirring lyrics. Additionally, I also enjoy exploring the vibrant world of hip hop music,
                        where
                        the energetic beats and powerful verses resonate with my spirit and ignite my creativity. Music
                        has
                        the remarkable ability to uplift my mood and transport me to a place of pure bliss.</p>
